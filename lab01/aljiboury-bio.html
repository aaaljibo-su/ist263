<title>Alba Aljiboury-Bio</title>
<body>Hi! I’m Alba Aljiboury, a junior majoring in Policy Studies and Information Management and Technology. I’m interested in work where the two intersect, like government consulting. I am a Global Ambassador for SU aboard, a Success Scholar, and am on track to graduate a year early. Outside of school and work, I love to read and have a bit of a green thumb, which has resulted in my room essentially turning into a library/indoor forest.</body>
