    Hi! I’m Alba Aljiboury, a junior majoring in <strong>Policy Studies</strong> and <strong>Information Management and Technology.</strong> I’m interested in work where the two intersect, like government consulting. I am a Global Ambassador for SU aboard, a Success Scholar, and am on track to graduate a year early.
